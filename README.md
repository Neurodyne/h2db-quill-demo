# Database and migrations integration project

Sample integration project for [Quill](https://github.com/getquill/quill), [H2 Database](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) and [FlyWay](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/migrations)

This project creates an in-memory (or persistant) H2 Database, runs `FlyWay` to create the initial migration, starts H2DB server, creates client and performs a basic `CRUD` (create, read, update, delete) operations
